## Set up
First time set up will take some time because this installs all the h2oai dependencies and the ai model in the docker container

Run `make build` for first time setup

`make up` to start rails and the ai model, or `make rails` to just start rails, then navigate to localhost:8080

`make down` to stop the containers
